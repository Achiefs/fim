It is capable of keeping historical data of your files. 
It checks the filesystem changes in the background.

FIM is the fastest alternative to other software like Ossec, which performs file integrity monitoring.

The produced data can be ingested and analyzed with tools like ElasticSearch/OpenSearch. 
It has developed with Rust, a popular programming language.
